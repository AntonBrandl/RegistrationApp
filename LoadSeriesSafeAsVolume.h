//
//  Probably the most common representation of datasets in clinical
//  applications is the one that uses sets of DICOM slices in order to compose
//  3-dimensional images. This is the case for CT, MRI and PET scanners. It is
//  very common therefore for image analysts to have to process volumetric
//  images stored in a set of DICOM files belonging to a
//  common DICOM series.
//
//  The following example illustrates how to use ITK functionalities in order
//  to read a DICOM series into a volume and then save this volume in another
//  file format.
//
//  The example begins by including the appropriate headers. In particular we
//  will need the \doxygen{GDCMImageIO} object in order to have access to the
//  capabilities of the GDCM library for reading DICOM files, and the
//  \doxygen{GDCMSeriesFileNames} object for generating the lists of filenames
//  identifying the slices of a common volumetric dataset.
